# Build Your Own wc Tool
This challenge (from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/)) is to build our own version of the Unix command line tool wc!

## Roadmap

 - Step 1: Write a simple version of wc that takes the command line option -c and outputs the number of **bytes** in a file.
 - Step 2: Add support for the command line option -l that outputs the number of **lines** in a file.
 - Step 3: Add support for the command line option -w that outputs the number of **words** in a file.
 - Step 4: Add support for the command line option -m that outputs the number of **characters** in a file.
 - Step 5: Add support for no command line options, which should default to the same output as a having the -c, -l, and -w options.
 - Step 6: Add support for being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified.
